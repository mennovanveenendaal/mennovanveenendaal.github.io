I'm Menno van Veenendaal, a Cyber Security consultant based in the Netherlands. When I'm not working, I enjoy working out, automating things around the house, or perfecting my Neapolitan pizza recipe.

## Experience
With a background in law enforcement, education in software programming and Cyber Security, and experience as a SOC analyst for a major Cyber Security company and the Royal Dutch Army, I've gained a broad range of knowledge in the Cyber Security field, including incident response.

## Forensics
From the beginning of my career, I’ve always had a passion for forensics. The strategic thinking and searching for that one critical piece of evidence really excite me. I especially enjoy the challenging cases where standard tools don’t work, and deeper investigation is needed. Whether it's taking a working image from a completely broken mobile phone or extracting data from unsupported devices, I’m always up for the challenge.

## Blog
While training for various certifications, building my home lab, and conducting research, I make it a habit to take notes. Note-taking helps me stay focused, and it allows me to replicate the steps in my lab or future projects. This blog is a collection of those notes, how-to guides, and research. Hopefully, I can learn from others who read this and maybe share a few useful insights along the way.

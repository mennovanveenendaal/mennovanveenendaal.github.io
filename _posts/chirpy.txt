At first I tried to use the theme by downloading the repository from GitHub and replacing the folder in my local repository. Meaby a bit naif, but this worked for the first theme I used. This didn't work for Chirpy theme. So I followed the official HowTo and used the Chirpy starter:

https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/

From the Chirpy GitHub site I pressed the `Use this template`, and then `Create a new repository`. This new repository should be named after your GitHub username.

# Setting up the Environment
For faster testing and to preview the site I wanted to preview the site locally. I decided to set the enviroment up natively.

https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/

For this I installed Ruby https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/ and RubyGems https://rubygems.org/pages/download. 
To check if these are installed correctly use `ruby -v` and `gem -v`.

On my local machine, in the folder where the website would be stored, I cloned the created repository `git clone`.
To install all the dependencies for Chirpy, the `bundle` command needs to be runned from the root of the repository. This will install the dependencies from the `Gemfile`. I got a error for the wdm gem. In the `Gemfile` I altered https://talk.jekyllrb.com/t/newbie-problems-with-wdm-errors/9233/8 the line `gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.1", :platforms => [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]`, to `"wdm", "~> 0.1", :platforms => [:mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin]`, and the install worked. 

# Jekyll Server
I could then run the site locally, using `bundle exec jekyll s` in the root folder. The server will be accassable via http://127.0.0.1:4000.

# Configuring the site
## Configuration File
In the `_config.yml` file I changed the following settings
url
avatar
timezone
lang

## Social Contact
In the file `_data/contact.yml` are the contact settings configured, this can be changed by commenting out the options, or removing the comments.

## Favicon
Lastly I changed the favicons. The original icons are located in the `_site/assets/img/favicons/` folder. I created new icons, renamed them to match the excisting naming convention of the favicons and replaced the icons in `_site/assets/img/favicons/`. After building the website, these new icons where used.
